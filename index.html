      <h1>Justin Ottesen</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my website! It is a bit quiet here right now; this project is a work in progress. I am using this as an opportunity to learn website development, as most of my experience has been deep in the data plumbing of applications. Everything here is made using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS with no framework on top. It is very important to me to understand the fundamentals before using tools to abstract all the details away.</p>
  
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>, while working part time as a Software Engineering Intern for <a href="https://www.nasuni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nasuni</a>. I have extensive experience in C, C++, Python, and Java, and I am working on adding Rust to that list. Outside of programming, I enjoy being outside, specifically running, hiking, and camping, as well as solving puzzles and playing games.</p>
