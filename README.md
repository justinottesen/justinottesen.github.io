This repository contains the code for my personal website. For the time being, it is hosted using [GitHub-Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Eventually I would like to deploy elsewhere and use my own HTTP server implementation, which is currently a work in progress.

The website should mostly speak for itself. I am using this as an introduction to web development, and to force me to learn as much as possible, I am using vanilla HTML, JS, and CSS. I hope this website will grow as I do.
